In order to maintain consistency across our repositories, the following settings and resources are mandatory:

1. **Repository Description**: A clear and concise description of the repository's purpose and contents. ([How-to Set](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/54372))

2. **Repository Topics**: Classifying the repository with topics. ([How-to Set](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics))

3. **License File**: A valid license file outlining the terms and conditions for repository use. ([How-to Add](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository))

4. **Readme File**: A comprehensive readme file providing essential information about the project, its setup, and usage. ([How-to Create](https://docs.github.com/de/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes))

5. **Maintainer File**: A file specifying maintainers, with the recommendation to include work email addresses for direct contact. ([Example](https://github.com/allianz-incubator/new-project/blob/main/MAINTAINERS))

6. **Contributing File**: A guide for contributors explaining how to contribute to the project. ([How-to Create](https://docs.github.com/de/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors))

To ensure these requirements, the repolinter tool is regularly executed, automatically creating issues for any deviations from the specified standards.
