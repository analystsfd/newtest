# Graduation from Incubator

## Purpose of Incubator
The Incubator at Allianz serves as a space for early-stage projects, where incomplete functionality, documentation, or missing processes are accepted and considered to be part of the setup process.

## Graduation Readiness Checks
If you believe your project is ready for prime time, please check the following key criteria:

1. Functionality: Confirm that a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) functionality is fully developed and operational.

2. Documentation: Ensure that comprehensive and accessible documentation is available for the project.

3. Best Practices: Validate that the project adheres to open source standards and [best practices](https://opensource.guide/).

## Initiate the Graduation Process
To kickstart the graduation process, either create a pull request on the configuration file [repos.yaml](../config/repos.yaml) or raise an issue.
