# Archiving a Repository

## Archiving

If a repository remains inactive for 365 days, an automated archival process is initiated to make the repository read-only and indicate that it's no longer actively maintained. Initially, an issue is created to inform the repository owner about the need to respond or update the repository. Without a reaction, the project will be archived. 

## Unarchiving

To request unarchiving, repository owners can create a ticket or reach out to us via email at [ospo@allianz.com](mailto:ospo@allianz.com).
